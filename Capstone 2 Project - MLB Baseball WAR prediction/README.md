This folder contains all my code, reports and presentations for my Springboard Capstone 2 Project.

For this project, I will be predicting MLB player WAR statistics (a measure of a players offensive and defensive on field production).  I will be using data sets from Baseball Prospectus and Lahman's that cover the 1977 - 2017 MLB seasons.  

Folders:

-   Code: contains my Jupyter Notebooks for EDA, Data Wrangling, Storytelling, Inferential Statistics and Machine Learning performed on the data set
-   Data Set: contains the Kaggle data set used for this project
-   Final Report and Presentation: contains the final report and presentation that contains a summary of all the learnings from the project
